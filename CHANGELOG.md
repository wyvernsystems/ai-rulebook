# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [4.4.1] - 2026-10-18

### Changed

- The license copyright holder is now Wyvern Systems LLC. The license is
  still MIT.
- The extension manifest lists Ron Picard (<https://wyvernsystems.com>) as
  the author, and the README credits Wyvern Systems.

## [4.4.0] - 2026-10-18

### Added

- A seventh rule, `review.mdc` (Review). It applies only when you explicitly
  ask an agent for a full code review, never on its own. The agent reviews
  every unpushed change (or a range you name) for bugs, security, dead code,
  duplication, improvements, tests, and docs, fixing as it goes, and reports
  licensing concerns without fixing them. It then runs tests, lint, and type
  checks, reports by pass, and commits and pushes, never force-pushing.
  Existing installs get the rule, enabled, on `Install / update rule pack`;
  turn it off in the sidebar like any other rule.
- `AI Rulebook: Enable fast parallel agent mode` and
  `AI Rulebook: Disable fast parallel agent mode`. The mode is off until you
  enable it. Enabling adds a separate managed block to `AGENTS.md` in every
  open folder that tells agents to finish sooner by splitting the work into
  units that each own their files, writing a shared contract first, running
  the ready units at the same time, then integrating, running the full checks,
  and fixing the combined result themselves, with one review of the whole
  diff on the strongest model. It uses more tokens than working alone, so it
  is a trade of cost for speed, and it is separate from Claude Code's `/fast`
  toggle. It writes no per-tool folders or settings. The rule pack commands
  never turn it on or remove it.
- `Show rule pack status` reports whether the mode is on.
- `AI Rulebook: Select agent mode…`: a quick pick with Off, Token-efficient
  subagent mode, and Fast parallel agent mode that marks the current one. It
  switches every open folder in one step, removing the other mode's block and
  writing the chosen one, so you no longer disable one mode before enabling
  the other. Off removes the mode blocks. The enable and disable commands
  remain in the command palette.
- The sidebar has an **Agent mode** row after the rules (Off, the mode, or
  `Conflict: more than one on`) that opens the picker, and the status bar
  shows the mode (`AI 7/7 · parallel`, `· subagent`). If both mode blocks are
  present the status bar warns (`AI 7/7 · 2 modes`) and `Show rule pack
  status` prints a warning; pick a mode to fix it.
- Fast parallel agent mode caps fan-out at five units at once, falls back to
  working alone when fan-out stops paying, and spells out how worktree units
  are merged: one at a time, checking each, resolving conflicts against the
  contract, and removing the worktrees.

### Changed

- The `scope.mdc` rule now has agents fix small, local defects they find while
  working, even outside the task (bugs, dead code, stale docs, broken tests),
  when the project's checks verify the fix, and list them under an "Also
  fixed" heading. They only report, without fixing, a defect whose fix would
  change a public interface or intended behavior, need a migration or
  dependency change, be large, or need a product decision. This replaces
  "report unrelated bugs, don't fix them".
- The `docs.mdc` rule asks for dense documentation for a reader who acts on
  it (human or agent): no filler, one fact in one place, lists and tables over
  prose, and agent-instruction files kept shortest.
- The `git.mdc` rule stages the task's changes together with its "Also fixed"
  items.
- Rule wording is tightened for agents: one instruction per bullet, the most
  often broken instruction first in each rule, and lines models already
  follow removed. Agents end every task with a report under fixed headings
  (Changed, Also fixed, Checks, Not done).
- The marketplace listing is renamed **AI Rulebook: AGENTS.md Rules for Coding
  Agents**, with a description and keywords naming `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
  and the supported tools so searches in Cursor, Open VSX, and the VS Code
  Marketplace find it. The extension ID `WyvernSystemsLLC.ai-rulebook` is
  unchanged, so existing installs update normally.
- The sidebar toolbar's four mode entries are replaced by one Select agent
  mode… entry.
- The sidebar and status bar refresh automatically when a workspace folder's
  root `AGENTS.md` changes on disk (git pull, branch switch, hand edit).
- Token-efficient subagent mode can no longer be enabled while fast parallel
  agent mode is on, and the reverse. The enable command checks every open
  folder first and, if any has the other mode, shows an error naming the
  disable command to run (or Select agent mode…) and writes nothing in any
  folder.

## [4.3.0] - 2026-09-19

### Added

- `AI Rulebook: Enable token-efficient subagent mode` and
  `AI Rulebook: Disable token-efficient subagent mode`. The mode is off until
  you enable it. Enabling adds a separate managed block to `AGENTS.md` in
  every open folder that tells agents to keep the session model for judgment
  and delegate searching, editing, and check runs to subagents on cheaper
  models. The text names model tiers (fast, standard, deep) instead of one
  vendor's models, says which tier to substitute when a model is unavailable,
  and carries each delegate's contract, so it works in any tool that reads
  `AGENTS.md` and has subagents. It writes no per-tool folders or settings.
  The rule pack commands never turn it on or remove it.
- `Show rule pack status` reports whether the mode is on.

## [4.2.0] - 2026-09-09

### Changed

- The Tests rule recommends a suitable linter when none is configured and
  allows adding or configuring it when requested or approved.

### Fixed

- Wrapped filesystem and manifest errors preserve their original cause for
  troubleshooting.

## [4.1.0] - 2026-09-09

### Changed

- Refined the existing rules with task-completion guidance, protection for
  existing work, behavior-focused tests, and final verification. Simplified
  documentation guidance and clarified conventions, dependency checks, and
  error handling while preserving all six rules and their toggles.

### Fixed

- Unreadable rule files now show an error in the sidebar instead of appearing
  disabled. Filesystem failures during project detection and legacy cleanup
  are reported instead of being treated as missing files.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-09-09

### Added

- `AI Rulebook: Remove rule pack` — deletes the managed block from
  `AGENTS.md` in every open folder, deleting `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`
  when only the default title or whitespace remains in `AGENTS.md` and
  only removable import lines remain in `CLAUDE.md`. Other user content
  remains; `CLAUDE.md` cleanup runs only when `AGENTS.md` is deleted.
- `AI Rulebook: Remove legacy per-tool rule folders…` — deletes the
  `.cursor/rules/ai-rules/`, `.clinerules/ai-rules/`,
  `.opencode/rules/ai-rules/` (plus the `/ai-rulebook` command),
  `.claude/rules/ai-rules/`, `.windsurf/rules/ai-rules/`, and
  `.github/instructions/ai-rules/` folders written by earlier releases.

### Changed

- **The rule pack now lives in `AGENTS.md`.** `Install / update rule pack`
  writes one managed block (between `<!-- ai-rulebook:start -->` and
  `<!-- ai-rulebook:end -->`) into `AGENTS.md`, creating the file or
  appending to an existing one. Updating an existing block preserves the
  text outside it; a first install may add separating newlines.
  Cursor, Cline, opencode, Windsurf, and supported GitHub Copilot features
  can read that file directly; see the README for tool-specific settings.
  Install also adds a `@AGENTS.md` import line to `CLAUDE.md`
  (creating it when missing) so Claude Code sees the same rules.
- **Toggling a rule edits its section of `AGENTS.md`.** The sidebar
  checkboxes and the enable / disable commands remove a disabled rule's text
  (leaving an empty, marked section) and write it back from the bundle when
  re-enabled. Re-running install keeps each rule's on / off state instead
  of turning everything back on.
- **Install applies to every open folder** in a multi-root workspace.
  Auto-install on open now runs in any folder that already shows signs of
  AI-agent use (an `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/`, `.clinerules/`,
  `.opencode/`, `.windsurf/`, or `.github/instructions/` entry, among
  others), on a Cursor host, or with Cline installed. Otherwise a one-time
  hint names the install command.
- Selecting a rule in the sidebar opens `AGENTS.md` at that rule's section.
  The status bar item now opens `Show rule pack status` and shows a warning
  when the block's markers are damaged; a damaged block is never rewritten.
- The standalone download is now a single `bundled/standalone/AGENTS.md`
  (attached to the GitHub release) instead of a ZIP per tool.

### Removed

- The per-tool mirrors and everything around them: the `Sync rule pack to
  …` and `Remove … rule pack` commands and their sidebar submenus, `Reset
  rule pack to defaults…`, `Hide rule colors`, the Explorer file tint, the
  opencode config and `/ai-rulebook` command edits, and the settings
  `aiRules.installCursorRulesFolder`, `aiRules.colorRulesInExplorer`, and
  `aiRules.autoSync{Cline,Opencode,Claude,Windsurf,Copilot}WhenInstalled`.
  `aiRules.autoInstallOnOpenWorkspace` and `aiRules.promptInstallOnUpdate`
  remain.
- The `bundled/rule-packs/` folders and the `package-rule-packs` script.

### Fixed

- Rapid rule toggles and overlapping install/remove actions no longer lose
  rule changes or corrupt `AGENTS.md` within one extension window.
- Removing the rule pack preserves `@AGENTS.md` examples inside fenced code
  blocks in `CLAUDE.md`.
- Old standalone rule-pack ZIP archives are excluded from the extension
  package.

### Upgrading

Existing per-tool folders are no longer updated. Run `Install / update rule
pack` to write `AGENTS.md`, then `Remove legacy per-tool rule folders…` to
delete the old mirrors. If your opencode config lists
`.opencode/rules/ai-rules/*.md` under `instructions`, drop that entry by
hand. Disabled states from legacy folders are not imported; reapply them
in the new sidebar. Older published releases retain their original layout.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-08-30

### Added

- **Open VSX publishing support.** Releases can now be published to the
  [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org) registry alongside the Visual Studio
  Marketplace, from the same `.vsix` artifact, reaching editors that default
  to Open VSX (VSCodium, Windsurf, Gitpod, Eclipse Theia, and other VS Code
  forks). `ovsx` is a new dev dependency and
  [docs/RELEASING.md](./docs/RELEASING.md) documents the publish step for
  both marketplaces. The extension is live on
  [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/WyvernSystemsLLC/ai-rulebook),
  so Cursor, Windsurf, VSCodium, and other fork users can install it from
  their Extensions panel.
- **README distribution and compatibility docs.** New *Get the extension*
  section describing the three distribution channels (Open VSX, the Visual
  Studio Marketplace, and GitHub releases), and a *Where it runs, and what
  it writes rules for* section separating the editors the extension runs in
  from the tools it generates rules for.

- **Windsurf and GitHub Copilot support.** The rule pack now mirrors to
  `.windsurf/rules/ai-rules/` and `.github/instructions/ai-rules/`, on the
  same footing as the existing Cline / opencode / Claude Code mirrors:
  automatic sync when the workspace shows evidence of that tool (a
  `.windsurf/` folder or `.windsurfrules` file; a
  `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file or `.github/instructions/` folder),
  new `Sync rule pack to Windsurf` / `Sync rule pack to GitHub Copilot` /
  `Remove Windsurf rule pack` / `Remove GitHub Copilot rule pack` commands,
  Explorer color-coding, and new `aiRules.autoSyncWindsurfWhenInstalled` /
  `aiRules.autoSyncCopilotWhenInstalled` settings (both default `true`).
  Standalone rule packs for both are also available under
  `bundled/rule-packs/windsurf/` and `bundled/rule-packs/copilot/` for
  anyone who doesn't want to install the extension.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- **`AGENTS.md` at the repo root.** Records the build/test commands and the
  rule-editing workflow (edit `bundled/ai-rules/`, run `npm run
  sync-bundled`, never edit the generated mirrors as source) for any AI
  coding agent working on this repo, per the expanded docs rule.

### Changed

- **`docs/DEPLOY.md` renamed to `docs/RELEASING.md`.** The file is a
  release-cutting checklist, and `RELEASING.md` is the conventional name the
  docs rule itself now recommends for that content. References in the
  README, `AGENTS.md`, and the requirements doc updated to match.
- **Docs brought in line with the docs rule.** The README has a
  **Limitations** section again, as the requirements doc mandates for the
  Marketplace description. The README, `AGENTS.md`, and the deploy notes no
  longer describe the generated rule folders (`.cursor/rules/ai-rules/` and
  the Cline / opencode / Claude Code mirrors) as committed in this repo —
  they were removed from tracking and are regenerated by the extension.
- **Tightened the scope, code, tests, and git rules.** `git.mdc` now says
  what to do when a commit *is* requested (stage only the task's files,
  imperative subject with a why) and forbids rewriting pushed history unless
  the user names the operation. `code.mdc` prefers the standard library over
  new dependencies, defines "unmaintained" checkably (archived, deprecated,
  or no release in ~2 years), and scopes input validation to trust
  boundaries. `tests.mdc` scopes test-first to behavior changes and makes
  the no-convention fallback deterministic (ask when the user is available,
  colocate when autonomous). `scope.mdc` adds: unrelated bugs get reported,
  not fixed.
- **Expanded `docs.mdc` rule.** The docs rule now covers the wider set of
  conventional documentation files — `AGENTS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/RELEASING.md`, and `docs/decisions/` (ADRs,
  numbered `NNNN-short-title.md`) alongside the existing README, CHANGELOG,
  and deploy triggers. Requirements now follow GitHub Spec Kit
  (`specs/<NNN-feature>/spec.md` with `plan.md` and `tasks.md`, principles
  in `.specify/memory/constitution.md`), with a single `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`
  still honored where a project already uses one. Testing docs fold into
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` rather than a separate file. The rule states the
  placement principle (platform-read files at the root, everything else in
  `docs/`), names the Keep a Changelog format with user-facing entries, and
  adds creation rules: docs are created by graduating an outgrown README
  section (~50 lines) or on a first-occurrence trigger, never speculatively —
  `specs/` only when the project uses Spec Kit or the user asks, and the
  first decision record only after confirming with the user. The rule also
  tells agents to scan the trigger list once before reporting a task done.

## [2.10.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- **Command reference in the README.** Every contributed command is now listed
  in a table with what it writes and which workspace folders it touches.

### Changed

- **Docs corrected**: the README, requirements, and deploy notes described
  `.cursor/rules/ai-rules/` as gitignored and absent on a fresh clone. The
  extension never writes a `.gitignore`, and that folder is committed in this
  repo like any other generated rule folder.

### Fixed

- **`Sync rule pack to all formats` no longer re-enables disabled rules.** It
  refreshed `.cursor/rules/ai-rules/` from the bundle before generating the
  mirrors, so every rule you had turned off came back on in all four formats.
  The sync commands now preserve rule state; `Install / update rule pack` and
  `Reset rule pack to defaults` still start from the bundled defaults.
- **`Sync rule pack to Cursor` no longer re-enables disabled rules**, for the
  same reason.
- **`Sync rule pack to all formats` now mirrors into every workspace folder.**
  It only wrote the first one, while the per-format sync commands wrote all of
  them. The `.cursor/` install stays scoped to the first folder.
- **`Sync rule pack to all formats` confirms what it wrote** when the opencode
  config could not be updated. It previously showed only the opencode warning,
  leaving the other three formats unacknowledged.
- **The status bar no longer goes stale.** The Cline, opencode, and Claude Code
  sync and remove commands did not refresh it, so clicking the status bar to
  sync opencode left its own indicator unchanged.
- **Remove commands now clear every workspace folder.** In a multi-root
  workspace they deleted only the first folder's rule packs while reporting
  that everything was removed. The confirmation dialog names the folder count.
- **Rule toggles no longer report a false success.** With no
  `.cursor/rules/ai-rules/` folder, the enable / disable commands and the
  sidebar checkboxes silently did nothing and still reported success. They now
  point at `Install / update rule pack`.
- **`AI Rulebook: Open rule file` is hidden from the command palette.** It
  needs a rule argument from the sidebar and did nothing when run from the
  palette.
- **`Hide rule colors` can no longer aim at a folder-scoped update.**
  `aiRules.colorRulesInExplorer` is window-scoped, so VS Code never resolves a
  per-folder value for it and rejects a `WorkspaceFolder` update on a
  configuration read without a resource. The command now writes to the
  Workspace scope when one overrides the value, and the User scope otherwise.

## [2.9.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- **Status bar item.** Shows the enabled-rule count for the first workspace
  folder plus the opencode config sync state, and clicks through to
  **Sync rule pack to opencode**.
- **Multi-root workspace support** for Cline, opencode, and Claude Code
  mirroring: auto-sync and their manual sync commands now run independently
  in every open workspace folder, judged on that folder's own evidence and
  Cursor rule state. (The `.cursor/rules/ai-rules/` install itself stays
  scoped to the first folder.)
- **Explorer coloring for Cline mirrors.** `.clinerules/ai-rules/` files are
  now tinted green / red alongside the Cursor, opencode, and Claude Code
  mirrors.
- **opencode `/ai-rulebook` command.** Syncing to opencode writes
  `.opencode/command/ai-rulebook.md`, a slash command that lists active and
  disabled rules. Removed alongside the rule mirror by the opencode and
  all-formats remove commands.

### Fixed

- **Auto-sync now surfaces opencode config failures.** Previously only the
  manual **Sync rule pack to opencode** command warned when the project's
  opencode config couldn't be parsed; the same warning now appears when the
  sync runs automatically on workspace open.
- **`Install / update rule pack` under-synced multi-root workspaces.** The
  command stopped mirroring to opencode/Claude Code after the first
  matching folder instead of syncing every folder with evidence.

## [2.8.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- **Manual sync and remove commands for every supported format.** New
  command-palette and sidebar submenu actions sync or delete the Cursor
  (`.cursor/rules/ai-rules/`), Cline (`.clinerules/ai-rules/`), opencode
  (`.opencode/rules/ai-rules/`), and Claude Code (`.claude/rules/ai-rules/`)
  rule packs individually, plus **Sync rule pack to all formats** and
  **Remove all rule packs**. Manual sync commands ignore host detection and
  auto-sync gates so they stay available in both Cursor and plain VS Code.
- **Sidebar Sync / Remove submenus** on the Rule Pack view expose the manual
  format commands without hiding any target based on the host application.

### Fixed

- **VSIX packaging.** `.vscodeignore` now excludes local mirror folders
  (`.claude/`, `.clinerules/`, `.opencode/`) and rule-pack zip build
  artifacts so they cannot leak into the extension package.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- **Standalone rule packs.** `bundled/rule-packs/` now ships in this repo
  with a ready-to-copy `ai-rules/` folder per tool — `cursor/`, `cline/`,
  `opencode/`, `claude-code/` — rendered from `bundled/ai-rules/` the same
  way the extension mirrors rules into a workspace. Anyone who doesn't want
  to install the extension can grab one directly. Each release now also
  attaches them as `ai-rulebook-rules-<tool>-X.Y.Z.zip` assets alongside the
  `.vsix`. Regenerated by `npm run sync-bundled`; packaged for release by the
  new `npm run package-rule-packs`.
- **Cline mirror stays in sync on toggle.** Enabling or disabling a rule —
  from the sidebar checkbox, the single-rule commands, or the enable/disable
  all commands — now updates `.clinerules/ai-rules/` immediately, the same
  way opencode and Claude Code mirrors already did. Previously the Cline
  mirror only reflected the pack's state at install/sync time.

### Changed

- **Docs reorganized under `docs/`.** `REQUIREMENTS.md` and `DEPLOY.md` moved
  to `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` and `docs/DEPLOY.md`; `README.md` and
  `CHANGELOG.md` stay at the repo root, since the VS Code Marketplace and
  GitHub read them from there.
- **`docs.mdc` states a default doc layout.** When a project has no existing
  documentation convention, the rule (and every rendered mirror — Cursor,
  Cline, opencode, Claude Code) now says to keep `README.md` and
  `CHANGELOG.md` at the repo root and put every other doc under `docs/`,
  linked from `README.md`. A project with its own convention keeps that
  instead.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- **Claude Code sync.** The rule pack can now be mirrored to
  `.claude/rules/ai-rules/` for Claude Code, alongside the existing Cursor,
  Cline, and opencode targets. Run **AI Rulebook: Sync rule pack to Claude
  Code**, or let it happen automatically when the workspace shows evidence of
  Claude Code (`CLAUDE.md`, `CLAUDE.local.md`, or a `.claude/` folder) — gated
  by the new `aiRules.autoSyncClaudeWhenInstalled` setting. Claude Code
  auto-discovers every `.md` file under `.claude/rules/`, so unlike opencode
  this needs no config file registration. The `markdown.mdc` rule's Cursor
  `globs` scoping is converted to Claude's `paths:` frontmatter so it still
  only loads for Markdown files.

## [2.5.2] - 2026-08-23

### Changed

- **Installed rule folders are no longer added to `.gitignore`.** The
  extension used to write `/.cursor/rules/ai-rules/`,
  `/.clinerules/ai-rules/`, and `/.opencode/rules/ai-rules/` into the
  workspace ignore file on every install and sync. That made the rules
  invisible to git, so teammates never saw them. Those entries are no longer
  written; rule folders can be committed and shared like any other project
  file. Existing entries already present in a workspace `.gitignore` are
  left alone.

## [2.5.1] - 2026-08-23

### Fixed

- **A fresh clone can build again.** `bundled/ai-rules/` is now the tracked
  source of truth for rule text. `.cursor/rules/ai-rules/` is no longer
  tracked, so `verify:bundled` and `sync-bundled` no longer require it —
  both previously exited 1 when it was absent, which broke `npm test` and
  `npm run package` on any fresh clone. The byte-identity check between the
  two folders was also unsatisfiable once rules began rendering
  `{{TEST_COMMAND}}` per project.
- **`verify:bundled` checks what has to hold.** It now confirms
  `bundled/manifest.json` lists exactly the rules in `bundled/ai-rules/`,
  that every rule has a `description` in its frontmatter, and that no rule
  ships an unknown `{{...}}` placeholder. `sync-bundled` regenerates the
  manifest from the bundle instead of copying a folder into it. A unit test
  covers manifest-to-directory agreement so the suite catches drift on its
  own.
- **Maintainer docs no longer ship in the VSIX.** `.vscodeignore` now excludes
  `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `DEPLOY.md`, and release-note scratch files, restoring
  the documented package contents: `out/**`, `bundled/**`, `icon.png`,
  `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `package.json`. `REQUIREMENTS.md`
  had been included since before 2.0.0.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-08-23

### Added

- **opencode support.** When the workspace shows evidence of opencode usage
  (an `AGENTS.md`, an `opencode.json` / `opencode.jsonc`, or a `.opencode/`
  folder) and `aiRules.autoSyncOpencodeWhenInstalled` is on, the extension
  mirrors the rule pack into `.opencode/rules/ai-rules/` as plain `<topic>.md`
  files (Cursor frontmatter stripped) and registers
  `.opencode/rules/ai-rules/*.md` in the `instructions` array of the
  project's opencode config, creating the config when absent. Config edits
  preserve JSONC comments and trailing commas; unparseable configs are left
  untouched with a clear warning.
- **opencode on / off state.** The mirror reflects the workspace's Cursor
  rule state: enabled rules live as `<topic>.md`, disabled rules as
  `<topic>.md.disabled` (skipped by the `*.md` instructions glob). Sidebar
  checkbox toggles and the enable / disable-all commands update the mirror
  immediately when opencode evidence exists and the auto-sync setting is on.
- **Red for disabled, everywhere.** The `aiRulebook.inactiveForeground`
  theme token now defaults to red (`#F85149` dark / high contrast, `#CF222E`
  light), so disabled rule labels appear red in both the AI Rulebook sidebar
  and the Explorer file tree.
- **Explorer colors for opencode rules.** `WorkspaceRuleFileColorer` now
  tints `.opencode/rules/ai-rules/*.md` files green (active) and
  `*.md.disabled` red, alongside the existing Cursor `.mdc` tinting. Tooltips
  name the loading agent ("loaded by Cursor" / "loaded by opencode").
- **`AI Rulebook: Sync rule pack to opencode`** command mirrors the pack to
  opencode manually, independent of the auto-sync gate.
- **New setting** `aiRules.autoSyncOpencodeWhenInstalled` (default `true`).
- **Tests**: opencode mirroring, frontmatter stripping, config resolution,
  JSONC-preserving `instructions` merging, the skip-on-invalid-config path,
  state-aware mirroring, and Explorer / sidebar decoration behavior are
  covered under `npm test`. The generated `.opencode/rules/ai-rules/`
  folder is added to the workspace `.gitignore` alongside the Cursor and
  Cline folders.
- **Test-command detection.** Rule text is rendered on the way into a
  workspace: the `{{TEST_COMMAND}}` token in `tests.mdc` is replaced with the
  project's actual command. Detection reads a real `package.json` `test`
  script (choosing `npm` / `pnpm` / `yarn` / `bun` from the lockfile), then
  `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, explicit pytest configuration, and a `test` target
  in a `Makefile`. Ambiguous projects fall back to the prose "the project's
  test command" rather than naming a command that does not exist. Rendering
  applies to the Cursor install, the reset-to-defaults path, and both the
  Cline and opencode mirrors.

### Changed

- **`tests.mdc` covers static checks, not just tests.** A new bullet requires
  running the lint and type checks a project already has and fixing what the
  change introduced, and forbids adding, configuring, or disabling a linter
  the project does not already use. The rule previously banned suppressing a
  lint rule without ever asking for one to be run. Phrasing is conditional on
  existing tooling, so it stays a no-op in projects that have none and never
  pushes an agent into the dependency and scope changes `code.mdc` and
  `scope.mdc` prohibit.
- **`markdown.mdc` is glob-scoped** to `**/*.{md,mdx}` instead of always-on.
  Its guidance only applies while editing Markdown, so it no longer consumes
  context on every other turn. The rule body keeps its "When editing `.md`
  files" preamble, which is what scopes it in the Cline and opencode mirrors
  where frontmatter is stripped.
- **`scope.mdc` resolves its own precedence.** A new bullet states that tests
  and documentation for the change itself are part of the task, so "change
  only what the task requires" can no longer be read as permission to skip
  the rules in `tests.mdc` and `docs.mdc`.

### Fixed

- **`tests.mdc` no longer ships an unfilled placeholder.** Every installed
  copy previously told the agent to run the literal text
  `<your test command>`, which nothing substituted.

### Documentation

- **`DEPLOY.md`** documents the release process: prerequisites, the
  versioning contract between `package.json`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and the git
  tag, the build and publish checklist, hotfix and rollback guidance, and
  what `.vscodeignore` lets into the VSIX.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-08-22

### Added

- **Tests**: `tests/safePaths.test.mjs`, `tests/manifest.test.mjs`, and
  `tests/rulesOperations.test.mjs` cover path containment, manifest
  validation, rule-pack toggle/install/reset, and Cline mirroring (`npm test`).
- **Generated rule folders stay local.** Install and Cline sync add
  `/.cursor/rules/ai-rules/` and `/.clinerules/ai-rules/` to the workspace
  `.gitignore`.

### Changed

- **Sidebar presentation refined.** Each rule uses a readable label, clearer
  tooltip, and consistent Enabled / Disabled wording. An
  empty-workspace welcome action opens a project folder.
- **Theme-aware UI palette.** New configurable enabled and disabled color
  tokens keep sidebar and Explorer styling consistent across light, dark, and
  high-contrast themes.
- **Rule pack split by topic.** Six always-on rules separately cover scope,
  code, tests, documentation, Markdown, and Git, and the extension installs,
  toggles, reports, and syncs each rule.
- **Rule-state commands expanded.** Command-palette actions can enable or
  disable one selected rule or the complete pack; all rules remain enabled by
  default.
- **Engineering guidance refined.** Rules prioritize task scope and local
  conventions, prohibit test weakening and unrequested Git mutations, and
  define explicit documentation-update triggers.
- **Clean compilation.** `npm run compile` removes stale `out/` files before
  rebuilding so deleted modules cannot enter the VSIX.
- **README simplified.** Setup, commands, rule location, and development steps
  now fit in a short quick-reference guide.

### Removed

- The consolidated `core.mdc`; its constraints now live in focused topic
  rules.
- Empty category folders, redundant global-mirror and one-item toggle commands,
  and the duplicated `ABOUT_RULES.md`.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added

- **`context-rules/`** folder: `dense-session-handoff-context.mdc` (@-mention)
  for a single paste-ready dense session summary; `low-token-session-habits.mdc`
  for terse long-session behavior when enabled.
- **Mode — Low token** (`aiRules.modeLowToken`): enables only the minimal rule
  subset for token-efficient long sessions (toolbar + command palette).
- **Tests**: `tests/modes.test.mjs` runs under `node --test` against compiled
  output (`npm test`). No new dependencies—uses Node's built-in test runner.

### Changed

- **Compressed** shipped `.mdc` rules for smaller context footprint without
  dropping core constraints.
- **Mode — Build** is lighter by default: turns **off** all `rules-for-rules/*`
  and **off** the secure-code coding rule only (documentation rules +
  `write-clean-code` + `organize-repository-by-feature` + `reuse` +
  `remove-dead-code` + `prefer-LTS` stay on). **Plan** and **Test** restore the
  full coding + meta set.
- **Lower `alwaysApply` footprint**: `update-changelog-for-notable-changes`
  and `append-and-deduplicate-requirements` now scope to their target file
  via `globs`; `evolve-rules-when-codebase-patterns-change` scopes to
  `**/.cursor/rules/ai-rules/**/*.mdc`.
- **`write-clean-code`** absorbs a one-line security baseline (no secrets,
  validate input, parameterized queries) so Build retains baseline guardrails
  even with `secure-code-data-and-dependencies` off.
- **`state-active-project-rules-in-prompt-response`** body trimmed.
- **`modes.ts`**: `MODE_PROFILES` replaced with `getModeProfile(mode, allMdcs)`;
  Low-token's disable list is now derived from the loaded manifest instead of a
  hand-maintained constant. Removed `EVERY_PACK_MDC`.
- **README** points to `bundled/ai-rules/ABOUT_RULES.md` for per-rule and
  per-mode detail; previous duplicated tables were removed.
- **`npm run sync-bundled`**: manifest lists logical `*.mdc` paths even when the
  workspace ships only `*.mdc.disabled`; install / Cline sync resolve the file
  variant on disk.

### Removed

- `coding-rules/verify-syntax-and-fix-before-finishing.mdc` (modern AIs handle
  syntax checking inline; the rule no longer earned its tokens).

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-30

### Changed

- **Marketplace icon refined.** Regenerated `icon.png` from a cleaner
  background-removed source. Pure black is mapped to transparent with a
  soft 25→80 luminance ramp for the glow halo (no alpha-unblending), so
  the cyan glow stays vibrant and the dark book pages remain readable
  on light themes. `icon-source.png` updated locally; still gitignored
  and excluded from the VSIX.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- **Host detection.** New `src/cursor.ts` exposes `isCursorHost()`, which
  returns `true` when `vscode.env.uriScheme === "cursor"` or
  `vscode.env.appName` contains `"cursor"` (case-insensitive). Symmetric
  with the existing Cline detection in `src/cline.ts`.
- **`aiRules.installCursorRulesFolder` setting.** Tri-state policy
  controlling the `.cursor/rules/ai-rules/` auto-install:
  - `"auto"` (default): only when the host is Cursor.
  - `"always"`: always (existing behavior; useful when committing rules
    for Cursor-using teammates from plain VS Code).
  - `"never"`: never. Manual install / reset / sidebar commands still
    work.
- **One-time non-Cursor host notice.** When the policy resolves to skip
  the auto-install, the user sees a single info toast with "Install now",
  "Open setting", and "Dismiss" actions. Persisted via `globalState` so
  it never repeats per machine.

### Changed

- **Auto-install split into Cursor and Cline tracks.** Cline mirroring
  (`.clinerules/ai-rules/`) is now independent of the Cursor folder
  install: a Cline user on plain VS Code still gets `.clinerules/ai-rules/`
  even when `.cursor/rules/ai-rules/` is skipped.
- **Marketplace icon refreshed** with a new open-book design (binary +
  graph + AI / gavel motif). White background removed (transparent
  alpha) so the icon looks correct on both light and dark themes. The
  high-resolution master is preserved locally as `icon-source.png`
  (gitignored, excluded from the VSIX).

### Unchanged

- All command IDs, settings names already in use, view IDs, and on-disk
  layouts (`.cursor/rules/ai-rules/`, `bundled/ai-rules/`,
  `.clinerules/ai-rules/`, `<globalStorage>/ai-rules-mirror/ai-rules/`)
  are unchanged. Existing keybindings, settings overrides, and rule
  folders keep working without migration.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-29

### Renamed

- **Package name**: `ai-rules` → `ai-rulebook` in `package.json`. The
  Marketplace package id is now **`WyvernSystemsLLC.ai-rulebook`** (was
  `WyvernSystemsLLC.ai-rules`), and `vsce package` produces
  `ai-rulebook-<version>.vsix` (e.g. `ai-rulebook-1.2.0.vsix`) instead of
  `ai-rules-<version>.vsix`. README and REQUIREMENTS updated to reflect
  the new id. No prior public Marketplace release used the old id, so
  this is a no-op for end users.

### Unchanged (stable contracts)

- On-disk rules layout stays `.cursor/rules/ai-rules/` and
  `bundled/ai-rules/`. Cline mirror stays `.clinerules/ai-rules/`. Global
  mirror stays `<globalStorage>/ai-rules-mirror/ai-rules/`. Command IDs
  stay `aiRules.*`, settings stay `aiRules.*`, view IDs stay
  `aiRules.rulesTree` / `aiRulesSidebar`. Existing keybindings, settings
  overrides, and on-disk rule folders keep working without migration.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-04-29

### Changed

- **Repository URL updated.** `package.json` `homepage`, `bugs.url`, and
  `repository.url` now point at
  `https://github.com/wyvernsystems/ai-rulebook-vscode-extension` (the repo
  was renamed from `cursor-rules-vscode-extension`). Marketplace package id
  (`WyvernSystemsLLC.ai-rules`), command IDs, settings, view IDs, and the
  on-disk rules layout are unchanged.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-29

### Changed

- **Renamed extension display: `AI Rules` → `AI Rulebook`.** All
  user-visible strings updated:
  - `package.json`: `displayName`, `description`, `keywords` (added
    `rulebook` and `ai-rules`), every command `title` / `category`, the
    activity-bar view container `title`, the rules tree
    `contextualTitle`, and the `configuration.title` block.
  - Every information / warning / error toast in `src/extension.ts`,
    `src/sidebarTreeView.ts`, and `src/ruleStatusUi.ts` now says
    "AI Rulebook" instead of "AI Rules".
  - The "AI Rules" Output channel is now "AI Rulebook".
  - `README.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md`, and `bundled/ai-rules/ABOUT_RULES.md`
    refer to the extension as **AI Rulebook**.
- **Internal contracts unchanged.** The install slug stays `ai-rules`
  (Marketplace id remains `WyvernSystemsLLC.ai-rules`), command IDs stay
  `aiRules.*`, settings stay `aiRules.*`, view IDs stay
  `aiRules.rulesTree` / `aiRulesSidebar`, and the on-disk rules layout
  stays `.cursor/rules/ai-rules/` and `bundled/ai-rules/`. Any existing
  keybindings, settings overrides, and on-disk rule folders keep working.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-04-29

### Changed

- **Publisher renamed** `wyvernsystems` → `WyvernSystemsLLC` in
  `package.json` to match the actual VS Code Marketplace publisher account.
  The Marketplace package id is now **`WyvernSystemsLLC.ai-rules`**. README
  and REQUIREMENTS updated to reflect the new id. No prior public
  Marketplace release used the old id (uploads were rejected with a
  publisher-mismatch error), so this is a no-op for end users.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed

- **`AI Rules: Hide active rules` did nothing when a Workspace-level
  `aiRules.colorRulesInExplorer` setting existed.** The command always wrote
  to `ConfigurationTarget.Global` (User scope), which is shadowed by any
  Workspace or Folder override—so the effective value never flipped to
  `false` and the green tint stayed. Both `Hide active rules` and
  `Show active rules` now write to whichever scope is currently overriding
  the value (folder > workspace > user) via `WorkspaceConfiguration.inspect`.
- Both commands now also call `explorerColors.refresh()` directly after the
  setting update, so the Explorer's decoration cache re-queries even if the
  `onDidChangeConfiguration` listener is debounced.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-29

First **stable** release. Marketplace listing, packaging, and rule pack
considered ready for general use. No breaking changes versus 0.5.0—command
IDs, settings, and on-disk format are stable.

### Added

- **`AI Rules: Hide active rules (no green)`** command. Sets
  `aiRules.colorRulesInExplorer` to `false` at the User scope so the green
  / muted tint disappears from the workbench Explorer. The AI Rules
  sidebar tree's colors are deliberately unaffected—the sidebar exists to
  surface on / off state, so removing color there would defeat its
  purpose.
- The companion `AI Rules: Show active rules` command now also flips
  `aiRules.colorRulesInExplorer` back to `true` (idempotent—no-op if
  already on) so the pair behaves symmetrically.
- Both commands are surfaced in the sidebar title-bar overflow menu under
  the **Inspect** group.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added

- **Explorer file-name coloring.** A new `WorkspaceRuleFileColorer`
  (`vscode.FileDecorationProvider`) tints `.mdc` files green and
  `.mdc.disabled` files muted gray in VS Code's built-in Explorer (and
  any other view that renders real `file://` URIs), for any rule under
  `.cursor/rules/ai-rules/` in the open workspace. Sibling to the existing
  sidebar tree decoration, which uses synthetic URIs.
- New setting `aiRules.colorRulesInExplorer` (default `true`) opts out of
  the Explorer coloring without affecting the AI Rules sidebar.
- Listening for `onDidChangeConfiguration` so flipping the setting
  re-publishes decorations without a reload.

### Changed

- **Renamed command** `AI Rules: Show pack status (green = active)` →
  `AI Rules: Show active rules (green = active)`. Command ID stays
  `aiRules.showPackStatus` so existing keybindings keep working. README,
  sidebar overflow menu, and changelog references updated.
- `RulesTreeProvider` now exposes a generic `onAfterRefresh(cb)` hook (used
  by both decoration providers) instead of the previous one-off
  `setDecorationProvider` setter.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added

- **Auto-Build mode on first install.** The first-time auto-install now
  finishes by applying the **Build** mode profile: `role-developer` is
  enabled and the other roles + every `test-rules/*` start disabled. Users
  who want a different default can flip modes from the sidebar title bar.
- **Colored sidebar rule labels.** A new `FileDecorationProvider` paints
  active rule labels in green (`testing.iconPassed`) and disabled rule
  labels in muted gray (`disabledForeground`), so on / off state is obvious
  in the sidebar tree without reading the description column.
- **README** got a dedicated **Sidebar tree view — turn rules on and off**
  section explaining the title-bar buttons, folder row actions, rule
  checkboxes, and the `Show pack status` flow.

### Changed

- **`AI Rules: Show pack status`** now focuses the AI Rules sidebar (where
  the colored state lives) and writes a plain-text log to **Output → AI
  Rules** alongside it, instead of dumping ANSI escape codes that VS Code's
  Output panel does not render. The Output channel is no longer auto-popped
  on every install / mode change.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added

- **Auto-install on first open.** When the extension activates in a workspace
  that does not yet have `.cursor/rules/ai-rules/`, it now drops the bundled
  rule pack into the workspace automatically (and mirrors to Cline if
  applicable). Existing rules folders are never overwritten — use the
  explicit **Install / update** or **Reset** commands for that. Re-runs on
  `onDidChangeWorkspaceFolders` so newly added folders pick up the pack.
- New setting `aiRules.autoInstallOnOpenWorkspace` (default `true`) to opt
  out of the auto-install.

### Changed

- **README reorder**: `## All commands`, `## Modes`, and `## Settings` now
  appear above `## Every rule that ships with this extension`, so a new user
  sees how to operate the extension before scrolling through the per-rule
  table. Quickstart updated to describe the new auto-install behavior.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-29

First Marketplace release.

### Renamed

- **Package name**: `wyvern-ai-rules` → `ai-rules`. The Marketplace
  package id is now `wyvernsystems.ai-rules` (publisher unchanged), and
  `vsce package` produces `ai-rules-<version>.vsix` (e.g.
  `ai-rules-0.2.0.vsix`) instead of `wyvern-ai-rules-<version>.vsix`. No
  prior public release used the old id.

### Added

- **Plain-English README** that doubles as the Marketplace description: an
  intro that explains what AI rules are and why to use them, the full per-rule
  table grouped by subfolder, every command (in plain English), every mode,
  every setting, and a *Limitations* section covering context-window pressure
  and rule-firing caveats.
- **`REQUIREMENTS.md`** capturing the working functional requirements,
  non-functional constraints (license, no network, no runtime deps, security
  invariants, VSIX contents), and explicit non-goals.
- **Sidebar tree view** (`AI Rules: Rules`) contributed under a new activity-bar
  view container `aiRulesSidebar`:
  - Subfolder → rule hierarchy with a real **TreeItem checkbox** per rule that
    flips `<name>.mdc` ↔ `<name>.mdc.disabled` via the existing rename helper.
  - Click a rule's label to open the `.mdc` file in the editor.
  - View title actions for **Plan / Build / Test / Role…** modes plus a
    refresh icon; overflow includes bulk install / enable-all / disable-all /
    reset / show-pack-status.
  - Folder rows expose inline **Enable / Disable** actions that toggle every
    rule under the selected subfolder.
- New commands wiring the sidebar: `aiRules.refreshTree`,
  `aiRules.revealRuleFile`, `aiRules.enableFolder`, `aiRules.disableFolder`.
- New module `src/sidebarTreeView.ts` (`RulesTreeProvider`,
  `bindRulesTreeView`, `RULES_TREE_VIEW_ID`).
- **Role rules** (`.cursor/rules/ai-rules/role-rules/`) — 8 audience-framing
  rules, off by default, toggled by the new mode commands:
  `role-developer.mdc`, `role-architect.mdc`, `role-tester.mdc`,
  `role-cyber-expert.mdc`, `role-product-manager.mdc`, `role-beginner.mdc`,
  `role-expert.mdc`, `role-end-user.mdc`.
- **Test rules** (`.cursor/rules/ai-rules/test-rules/`) — 5 testing playbooks,
  off by default, enabled together by `Mode — Test`:
  `write-unit-tests.mdc`, `write-smoke-tests.mdc`,
  `write-regression-tests.mdc`, `write-integration-tests.mdc`,
  `write-end-to-end-tests.mdc`.
- **Mode commands**:
  - `AI Rules: Mode — Plan` (architect role, no test rules)
  - `AI Rules: Mode — Build` (developer role, no test rules)
  - `AI Rules: Mode — Test` (tester role + every test rule)
  - `AI Rules: Mode — Role…` (QuickPick: enable one role, disable the others)
- New module `src/modes.ts` defining the mode preset shape and helpers
  (`applyModeProfile`, `applyRolePick`, `MODE_PROFILES`, `ROLE_RULES`,
  `TEST_RULES`).
- New module `src/safePaths.ts` — `isSafeManifestEntry`,
  `assertContainedPath`, `assertSafeDeletionTarget` — used at every boundary
  that resolves a manifest entry under a base directory.
- **`LICENSE`** (MIT) at the repo root, shipped in the VSIX.
- **`icon.png`** (128×128) at the repo root for the Marketplace listing.
  Hi-res master kept locally as `icon-source.png` (excluded from the VSIX
  and from git).

### Changed

- **Rule pack: simplified and deduped.** Every rule under
  `.cursor/rules/ai-rules/` rewritten as a tighter, scannable bullet list so
  models with limited context can honor every active rule. Cross-rule overlap
  removed.
- **Rename**: `rules-for-rules/state-active-project-rules.mdc` →
  `rules-for-rules/state-active-project-rules-in-prompt-response.mdc`. Body
  reduced to a "print a bullet list of active rule paths" instruction so the
  rendered `### Active project rules` block stays short and accurate when
  rules are toggled.
- **`src/extension.ts`** routes all destructive / copy operations through
  helpers in `src/rulesOperations.ts` (`copyManifestFiles`,
  `replaceGlobalMirror`, `removeGlobalMirror`) instead of inline `fs.rm` /
  `fs.cp` calls.
- **Marketplace metadata** filled in: `license: MIT`, `icon: icon.png`,
  `homepage`, `bugs`, `keywords`, `engines.node ≥ 18.18.0`, repo URL switched
  to `git+https://...` form for `vsce` compatibility. `package.json#files`
  removed (vsce 3.x requires `.vscodeignore` instead).
- **`.vscodeignore`** tightened: source, scripts, lockfiles, build info,
  hi-res icon source, and `*.vsix` excluded from the packaged extension.
  Only compiled JS, bundled rules, the 128×128 icon, README, CHANGELOG, and
  LICENSE are shipped.
- **`.gitignore`** ignores `*.tsbuildinfo` and `icon-source.png`.
- Reorganized the rule pack into five subfolders inside
  `.cursor/rules/ai-rules/`: `coding-rules/`, `documentation-rules/`,
  `role-rules/`, `rules-for-rules/`, `test-rules/`.
- `mdc:` cross-links and `state-active-project-rules.mdc` template updated
  to use the subfolder paths.
- Dropped the duplicate "Duplication: extract on third repetition" bullet
  from `coding-rules/write-clean-code.mdc` (covered by
  `coding-rules/reuse-code-before-duplicating.mdc`).

### Removed

- `rules-for-rules/maintain-cursor-rules.mdc` — content folded into
  `rules-for-rules/write-cursor-rules-for-this-project.mdc`, which is now the
  single source for both authoring and ongoing maintenance / deprecation
  guidance for rule files. Both rules previously shared the same `globs`
  scope and overlapping content.

### Security

- **Validated bundled manifest at load.** `src/manifest.ts` now schema-checks
  `bundled/manifest.json`: rejects missing fields, non-array `files`, and
  any entry that fails the safe-path predicate (`^[A-Za-z0-9_./-]+$`, no
  `..`, no leading `/` or `./`, ≤ 200 chars). A tampered manifest aborts
  activation with a clear error instead of being trusted.
- **Path containment checks** on every operation that resolves a manifest
  entry under a base directory (bundle, workspace rules dir, global mirror,
  Cline mirror).
- **Destructive operations gated by suffix assertions.**
  `resetRulesDirToBundle` refuses to delete a path that doesn't end with
  `.cursor/rules/ai-rules`; `replaceGlobalMirror` / `removeGlobalMirror`
  refuse paths not ending with `ai-rules-mirror/ai-rules`.
- **Recursive copies refuse symlinks.** The `fs.cp(...)` calls that mirror
  the bundle into the workspace and global storage now use a `filter`
  callback that skips symbolic links. The directory walker in
  `deleteUnshippedFiles` also skips symlinks.
- **Hardened `aiRules.revealRuleFile` arguments**: rejects non-string args,
  unsafe shapes, and any `rulePath` not present in the validated manifest
  before resolving / opening.
- **Friendlier failure surface**: if `bundled/manifest.json` is missing or
  invalid, the user sees the underlying reason in the error toast instead
  of a generic "missing copy" string.

### Fixed

- `scripts/sync-bundled.mjs` walks recursively when generating
  `bundled/manifest.json`, so manifest paths include subfolders (e.g.
  `coding-rules/write-clean-code.mdc`).
- `src/rulesOperations.ts`:
  - `installBundleToRulesDir` and `setRuleEnabled` create parent
    directories before copying or renaming, so subfolder rules install and
    toggle correctly.
  - `deleteUnshippedFiles` walks the rules directory recursively when
    checking which files are part of the bundle.
  - The Cline mirror writer flattens any subfolder path into the output
    filename (`ai-rules-coding-rules-write-clean-code.md`) to avoid
    collisions and keep `.clinerules/ai-rules/` flat.
  - `EVOLVE_RULE` points at
    `rules-for-rules/evolve-rules-when-codebase-patterns-change.mdc`.
- `ABOUT_RULES.md` and `README.md` describe the current layout.
