# AI Rulebook

AI Rulebook is a VS Code extension that installs a small set of always-on
engineering rules for AI coding agents into your project's `AGENTS.md`. Seven
topic rules cover scope, code reuse, testing, docs, Markdown, Git, and
on-request code review. A
sidebar lets you turn each rule on and off, and every toggle edits that
rule's section of `AGENTS.md` in place.

The same file can be used by Cursor, Cline, opencode, Windsurf, and supported
GitHub Copilot features. Support depends on the tool and its settings; see
[Per-tool notes](#per-tool-notes). Claude Code reads `CLAUDE.md`, so the
extension adds a one-line `@AGENTS.md` import there.

## Get the extension

Version 4.0.0 moves the rule pack into `AGENTS.md`. Releases through 3.1.0
use the older per-tool layout; see [Upgrading from the per-tool layout](#upgrading-from-the-per-tool-layout)
before migrating an existing workspace.

Distribution channels are:

- [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/WyvernSystemsLLC/ai-rulebook) —
  search for **AI Rulebook** in editors configured to use this registry,
  including Cursor. If other "AI" extensions bury it, search for the ID
  `WyvernSystemsLLC.ai-rulebook` instead.
- The Visual Studio Marketplace — search for **AI Rulebook** in stock VS
  Code, when the version you need has been published there.
- [GitHub releases](https://github.com/wyvernsystems/ai-rulebook-vscode-extension/releases)
  — download an attached `ai-rulebook-X.Y.Z.vsix` for manual installation
  (`code --install-extension ai-rulebook-X.Y.Z.vsix`, or Extensions panel →
  `...` → **Install from VSIX...**). Release assets vary by version; older
  releases used per-tool rule ZIPs. The current release workflow attaches a
  standalone `AGENTS.md` instead.

## Where it runs, and what it writes rules for

Two different compatibility lists matter, and they are independent:

- **Editors it runs in** — VS Code-compatible hosts supporting the
  extension API declared in `package.json` (`^1.85.0`), such as VS Code, Cursor,
  Windsurf, VSCodium, code-server / OpenVSCode Server, Eclipse Theia, and
  other forks. The sidebar and commands work the same in all of them.
- **Tools that read the rules** — anything that reads `AGENTS.md`: Cursor,
  Cline, opencode, Windsurf, supported GitHub Copilot features, and more.
  Claude Code reads the same file through the `@AGENTS.md` import in `CLAUDE.md`. The tool does
  not have to run inside the same editor: Claude Code and opencode are
  terminal tools, and `AGENTS.md` is meant to be committed so teammates get
  the rules without installing anything.

## What gets written

**Install / update rule pack** writes one managed block into `AGENTS.md`,
creating the file when the project has none and appending the block when it
already exists. Updating an existing block preserves the text before and
after it; first-time installation may add separating newlines.

```markdown
<!-- ai-rulebook:start -->
<!-- Managed by the AI Rulebook extension. ... -->

<!-- ai-rulebook:rule scope enabled -->

## Scope

- Change only what the task requires. ...

<!-- ai-rulebook:end-rule scope -->

<!-- ai-rulebook:rule git disabled -->
<!-- ai-rulebook:end-rule git -->
<!-- ai-rulebook:end -->
```

Each rule has its own section. Disabling a rule removes its text and marks
the section `disabled`; enabling it writes the text back from the bundle.
A disabled rule is removed from this block rather than commented out; copies in other files
and instructions already loaded into an agent session are unaffected.
Re-running install refreshes the wording of every section and keeps each
rule's on / off state.

Install also makes sure `CLAUDE.md` imports `AGENTS.md`, creating the file
with the line `@AGENTS.md` when it is missing and appending the line when there is no detected
import outside code fences or inline code. Existing imports in prose count.
The extension does not replace your existing `CLAUDE.md` instructions.

## Commands

The commands below are available from the command palette
(`Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P`) under **AI Rulebook**. The sidebar toolbar provides
refresh, install, remove, legacy cleanup, agent mode selection, status, and whole-pack toggles; use its
checkboxes or the palette for individual rules.

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Install / update rule pack** | Writes or refreshes the managed block in `AGENTS.md` and the `@AGENTS.md` import in `CLAUDE.md`, in every open folder. Rules you turned off stay off. |
| **Enable all rules (workspace)** | Writes every rule's text back into `AGENTS.md`. |
| **Disable all rules (workspace)** | Removes every rule's text from `AGENTS.md`, keeping the empty sections. |
| **Enable one rule…** | Picks a rule from a list and writes its section. |
| **Disable one rule…** | Picks a rule from a list and empties its section. |
| **Remove rule pack** | Deletes the managed block from `AGENTS.md` in every open folder after a confirmation. `AGENTS.md` is deleted when empty or only its default title remains; otherwise user text remains. Import cleanup runs only when `AGENTS.md` is deleted. |
| **Remove legacy per-tool rule folders…** | Deletes the folders earlier releases generated (`.cursor/rules/ai-rules/`, `.clinerules/ai-rules/`, `.opencode/rules/ai-rules/` plus its `/ai-rulebook` command, `.claude/rules/ai-rules/`, `.windsurf/rules/ai-rules/`, `.github/instructions/ai-rules/`) after a confirmation. |
| **Enable token-efficient subagent mode** | Off by default. Writes or refreshes the mode's own block in `AGENTS.md` (and the `@AGENTS.md` import in `CLAUDE.md`) in every open folder. It writes no other files. See [Token-efficient subagent mode](#token-efficient-subagent-mode). |
| **Disable token-efficient subagent mode** | Removes that block from `AGENTS.md` in every open folder. |
| **Enable fast parallel agent mode** | Off by default. Writes or refreshes the mode's own block in `AGENTS.md` (and the `@AGENTS.md` import in `CLAUDE.md`) in every open folder. It writes no other files and cannot be enabled while token-efficient subagent mode is on (the error points to **Select agent mode…**). See [Fast parallel agent mode](#fast-parallel-agent-mode). |
| **Disable fast parallel agent mode** | Removes that block from `AGENTS.md` in every open folder. |
| **Select agent mode…** | Opens a quick pick with Off, Token-efficient subagent mode, and Fast parallel agent mode, marking the current one (read from the first folder). It switches every open folder in one step: it removes the other mode's block and writes the chosen one in a single write, so you do not have to disable one mode before enabling the other. Off removes the mode blocks (and deletes `AGENTS.md` and its `CLAUDE.md` import when nothing else remains). |
| **Show rule pack status** | Focuses the sidebar and writes the on / off state of each rule, of subagent mode, and of fast parallel agent mode to the **AI Rulebook** output channel. If both mode blocks are present it adds a warning line. |
| **Refresh sidebar** | Re-reads `AGENTS.md` and repaints the sidebar and status bar. |

Install, remove, the legacy-folder cleanup, and the agent mode commands
(including **Select agent mode…**) apply to every open workspace folder. The four enable / disable mode commands stay in the command palette; the sidebar toolbar has the single **Select agent mode…** entry. The sidebar, the status bar, and the rule toggles read and edit the
first workspace folder's `AGENTS.md`.

Selecting a rule's name in the sidebar opens `AGENTS.md` at that rule's
section via **Open rule file**, which is hidden from the command palette.

Removal decides whether to delete a file from its remaining content; it does
not record who originally created it. When `AGENTS.md` is deleted, cleanup
removes standalone `@AGENTS.md` lines outside fences from `CLAUDE.md` and
deletes that file if empty. Inline prose imports and fenced examples remain.
When `AGENTS.md` remains, its `CLAUDE.md` import remains too. Removal may
normalize blank lines around the former block.

## The rules

- **`scope.mdc`** — inspect relevant code and commands, complete and verify
  the task, resolve routine choices autonomously, keep changes in scope,
  and follow conventions without overriding safety or verification. Agents
  also fix small, local, check-verified defects they find along the way
  (bugs, dead code, stale docs, broken tests) and list them under an "Also
  fixed" heading; larger or behavior-changing ones are only reported.
  Every task ends with a report under fixed headings: Changed, Also fixed,
  Checks, Not done.
- **`code.mdc`** — reuse helpers, validate input where it enters, protect
  secrets, preserve error causes with actionable context, and check
  dependency maintenance and compatibility.
- **`tests.mdc`** — never report an unrun check as passing or weaken a check
  to pass, test observable behavior at the appropriate level,
  reproduce bugs with regression tests when feasible, run project tests and
  existing lint/type checks, recommend a suitable linter when absent and add
  it only when requested or approved, and inspect the final diff.
- **`docs.mdc`** — update documentation made inaccurate by the change,
  follow the project's layout, add user-facing release notes when appropriate,
  and create documentation only when requested or needed to explain changed
  behavior. Documentation is written densely for a reader who acts on it
  (human or agent), with one fact in one place, and agent-instruction files
  are kept shortest.
- **`markdown.mdc`** — one H1, no skipped heading levels, `-` bullets,
  language-tagged code fences, inline code for paths and commands, relative
  links.
- **`git.mdc`** — preserve existing work; no commits, pushes, or branches
  unless asked; stage only your changes (the task and its "Also fixed"
  items), inspect the staged diff, and never rewrite pushed history unless
  the user names the operation.
- **`review.mdc`** — applies only when you explicitly ask for a full code
  review. Covers unpushed changes (or a range you name) in passes for bugs,
  security, dead code, duplication and structure, improvements, tests, and
  docs, fixing as it goes, and reports licensing concerns without fixing
  them. Runs tests, lint, and type checks, reports changes by pass, then commits and
  pushes (asking for the review is the request to do so unless you say
  otherwise) and never force-pushes.

The rules are authored as Cursor `.mdc` files in `bundled/ai-rules/`. On the
way into `AGENTS.md` the frontmatter is dropped and each rule's heading is
nested one level under the file's own title. `AGENTS.md` has no per-file
frontmatter scoping for these sections, so the Markdown rule is loaded with
the pack; its text still limits its guidance to editing Markdown files.

`tests.mdc` names your project's own test command. On install the extension
detects it from a `package.json` `test` script (using the lockfile to pick
`npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, or `bun`), `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, pytest
configuration, or a `test` target in a `Makefile`. When nothing is
conclusive the rule says "the project's test command" instead of guessing.

## Token-efficient subagent mode

This optional mode tells an agent to spend its expensive session model on
judgment only (reading the request, planning, writing specs, the final
report) and to delegate searching, editing, and check runs to subagents on
cheaper models. It is **off by default** and is not part of the seven-rule
pack: installing, toggling, or removing the pack never touches it, and
**Enable all rules** does not turn it on.

**Enable token-efficient subagent mode** writes one block into `AGENTS.md`
in every open folder, between `<!-- ai-rulebook:subagent-mode:start -->` and
`<!-- ai-rulebook:subagent-mode:end -->`, and makes sure `CLAUDE.md` imports
`AGENTS.md`. That is all it writes: no `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.cursor/`, or
other per-tool folders, and no tool settings. Run it again to refresh the
wording and the detected test command. **Disable token-efficient subagent
mode** removes the block, and deletes `AGENTS.md` (and its `CLAUDE.md`
import) only when nothing else is left in it.

The text is written for any tool that reads `AGENTS.md` and has subagents,
including Claude Code, ChatGPT / Codex, Cursor, opencode, and GitHub Copilot.
It relies on the orchestrating model to follow it:

- **Model tiers, not model names.** Work is assigned to a fast, standard, or
  deep tier, with examples from several vendors, so each tool uses its own
  models. Tools without subagents are told to skip the section.
- **Substitutes.** When a tier's model is not offered, blocked by policy,
  failing, or rate-limited, the agent substitutes in a fixed order: fast
  falls back to standard and then the session model, standard to the session
  model, deep to the session model or standard at high effort. It never picks
  a model more expensive than the session model, tells you once, and keeps
  the substitute for the rest of the session.
- **Delegate contracts.** The block states what an implementer, test runner,
  and reviewer must do and how each replies, so no agent definition files
  are needed.
- **No retry loops.** When a delegate's edit is wrong or its check fails,
  the orchestrator fixes it itself. An incomplete spec is resent once, and
  the same change never gets a third delegate.
- **Accuracy checks.** High-risk diffs (concurrency, security, auth,
  credentials, persistence, migrations) get one read-only review on the
  strongest model after the checks pass, and the orchestrator reads the
  final diff itself before reporting.

Because these are instructions rather than configuration, a tool only runs a
subagent on a cheaper model when its spawn call lets the agent choose one
(Claude Code's does). Where it does not, delegation still keeps file
contents and command output out of the session context, which is the larger
saving.

It cannot be on at the same time as [fast parallel agent
mode](#fast-parallel-agent-mode), because the two pull in opposite
directions: enabling either one fails while the other is on.

## Fast parallel agent mode

This optional mode tells an agent to finish sooner by splitting the work into
units, running them at the same time, and then integrating and verifying the
result itself. It is **off by default** and is not part of the seven-rule pack:
installing, toggling, or removing the pack never touches it, and **Enable all
rules** does not turn it on.

It uses **more tokens** than working alone: it trades cost for wall-clock
speed, the opposite of token-efficient subagent mode. It is not related to
Claude Code's own `/fast` toggle, which speeds up the output of one model;
the two can be used together.

**Enable fast parallel agent mode** writes one block into `AGENTS.md` in every
open folder, between `<!-- ai-rulebook:parallel-mode:start -->` and
`<!-- ai-rulebook:parallel-mode:end -->`, and makes sure `CLAUDE.md` imports
`AGENTS.md`. That is all it writes: no per-tool folders and no tool settings.
Run it again to refresh the wording and the detected test command. **Disable
fast parallel agent mode** removes the block, and deletes `AGENTS.md` (and its
`CLAUDE.md` import) only when nothing else is left in it.

The text is written for any tool that reads `AGENTS.md` and can run subagents
in parallel; other tools are told to skip it. It relies on the orchestrating
agent to follow it:

- **Scale to the task.** A change in one file, or steps that each depend on
  the last, is done directly without fan-out.
- **Units by file ownership.** Every file that will change belongs to exactly
  one unit, and a shared contract (names, signatures, types, paths,
  behavior) is written before fan-out so units build to it. Ready units are
  spawned in one message.
- **No downgraded implementers.** Implementers get a model at least as capable
  as their unit needs; smaller models are fine for searches and check runs.
- **At most five units at once.** More units hit rate limits and make
  integration harder than the time they save, so small related changes are
  folded into one unit.
- **No shared files.** Two units never edit the same file in the same
  checkout: use git worktrees or run them in sequence.
- **Fall back to working alone.** If splitting proves harder than the work,
  or units keep waiting on each other, the agent stops spawning and finishes
  the rest itself.
- **Integrate and fix.** The orchestrator brings the units together, runs the
  full test, lint, and type checks on the combined result, and fixes
  integration failures itself, with at most two repair rounds before it
  reports what still fails. Worktree units are merged into the main checkout
  one at a time: it reads each diff, applies it, checks it, resolves
  conflicts against the contract without dropping either side, and removes
  the worktree.
- **One required review.** The combined diff gets one read-only review on the
  strongest model, then the orchestrator reads the final diff itself.
- **Delegate contracts.** The block states what an implementer, researcher,
  and reviewer must do and how each replies.

**Mutual exclusion.** The mode cannot be enabled while token-efficient
subagent mode is on, and token-efficient subagent mode cannot be enabled
while this mode is on. The enable command checks every open folder first; if
any folder has the other mode, it shows an error naming **Select agent mode…**
and the disable command, and writes nothing in any folder. **Select agent
mode…** is the one-step way to switch.

As with subagent mode, these are instructions rather than configuration: the
mode cannot force parallelism or pick models, and it cannot guarantee that
your tool supports git worktrees.

## Just want the rules?

You don't need the extension to use these rules.
[`bundled/standalone/AGENTS.md`](./bundled/standalone/AGENTS.md) is the file
the extension writes into a fresh workspace. The current release workflow
also attaches it to GitHub releases. Copy it to your project root, or paste
the block between
the `ai-rulebook:start` and `ai-rulebook:end` markers into an existing
`AGENTS.md`, then replace "the project's test command" in the Tests rule with
your real command. Keep both outer markers when pasting. Do not overwrite an
existing file or append a second managed block. For Claude Code, create
`CLAUDE.md` with `@AGENTS.md`, or append that line to the existing file.

## VS Code and other hosts

**Install**

Search for **AI Rulebook** in the Extensions panel, or install the VSIX from
a [GitHub release](https://github.com/wyvernsystems/ai-rulebook-vscode-extension/releases)
— see [Get the extension](#get-the-extension). To build it yourself:
`npm ci && npm test && npm run package` (see [Development](#development)
for prerequisites).

**Use**

1. Open a project folder.
2. If the project already shows signs of AI-agent use (an `AGENTS.md`,
   `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursor/`, `.clinerules/`, `.opencode/`, `.windsurf/`, or
   `.github/instructions/` entry, among others), or the host is Cursor, or
   the Cline extension is installed, the rule pack installs automatically on
   activation if its block is missing and auto-install is enabled. Otherwise
   run **AI Rulebook: Install / update rule pack**. When auto-install skips a
   project for lack of agent evidence, it shows a one-time hint.
3. Toggle rules with the **AI Rulebook** sidebar checkboxes or the
   command-palette commands. Each toggle edits `AGENTS.md`.
4. Commit `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` so teammates and terminal tools get
   the same rules.

## Per-tool notes

- **Cursor** — supports root and nested `AGENTS.md` files; this extension
  manages only the workspace-root file. See [Cursor rules](https://cursor.com/docs/rules).
- **Cline** — recognizes `AGENTS.md` alongside its other rule sources. Check
  Cline's own Rules panel if the file is disabled there. An installed Cline
  extension is evidence for AI Rulebook's auto-install. See [Cline rules](https://docs.cline.bot/customization/cline-rules).
- **opencode** — reads `AGENTS.md` as project instructions; no extra config
  entry is needed. See [opencode rules](https://opencode.ai/docs/rules/).
- **Windsurf / Cascade** — the root `AGENTS.md` applies across the workspace;
  nested files can have narrower scope. The Windsurf documentation now
  redirects to [Devin Desktop's AGENTS.md guide](https://docs.devin.ai/desktop/cascade/agents-md).
- **GitHub Copilot** — support varies by client and feature; see
  [GitHub's support matrix](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/custom-instructions-support).
  In VS Code, `chat.useAgentsMdFile` controls loading; see
  [VS Code custom instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/agent-customization/custom-instructions).
  AI Rulebook does not change that setting.
- **Claude Code** — imports the shared file through `@AGENTS.md` in
  `CLAUDE.md`. See [Claude Code memory](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory).
  AI Rulebook leaves detected prose imports alone and ignores examples in
  code fences or inline code when checking for an import.

## Upgrading from the per-tool layout

Earlier releases mirrored the rules into a folder per tool. Those folders
are no longer written or updated. After installing this version:

1. Run **AI Rulebook: Install / update rule pack** to write `AGENTS.md`.
2. Run **AI Rulebook: Remove legacy per-tool rule folders…** to delete the
   old mirrors, and drop the `.opencode/rules/ai-rules/*.md` entry from your
   opencode config if you had one.
3. Reapply any rules you previously disabled: the new block starts with all
   bundled rules enabled and does not import state from the old folders.

## Notes

- The extension never edits `.gitignore`. `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` are
  meant to be committed.
- Disable automatic installation with
  `aiRules.autoInstallOnOpenWorkspace: false`.
- Disable version-change prompts with `aiRules.promptInstallOnUpdate: false`.
  Both settings default to `true`. The prompt is tracked per extension
  installation, not separately for every workspace.
- Everything outside the managed block in `AGENTS.md` is yours. The
  extension preserves it when updating an existing block and refuses to
  overwrite a block whose markers are damaged. Fix the markers manually;
  the removal command also requires a valid block.
- A status bar item shows the enabled-rule count and the agent mode
  (`AI 7/7 · parallel` or `AI 7/7 · subagent`; the tooltip names the mode);
  click it to show the rule pack status. If both mode blocks are present
  (a hand edit or merge), it shows a warning (`AI 7/7 · 2 modes`), the
  sidebar **Agent mode** row shows the conflict, and the status output prints
  a warning; pick a mode with **Select agent mode…** to fix it.
- The sidebar has an **Agent mode** row after the rules showing Off, the
  active mode, or `Conflict: more than one on`; selecting it opens the picker.
- The sidebar and status bar refresh after every command that edits
  `AGENTS.md` and automatically when each workspace folder's root `AGENTS.md`
  changes on disk (git pull, branch switch, hand edit). **Refresh sidebar**
  remains available.
- If the sidebar cannot read or parse `AGENTS.md`, rules show **Unable to
  read** with details in the tooltip. Fix the file and refresh the sidebar
  to restore the checkboxes.
- The rule toggles edit sections inside the managed block, so they need the
  pack to be installed. Without it the sidebar checkboxes and the
  enable / disable commands report that the rule pack is not installed yet.

## Development

Use Node.js 24 for development, linting, and packaging. ESLint requires
Node.js 20.19+, 22.13+, or 24+. The extension still declares Node.js
`>=18.18.0`; CI tests Node 18 and 20 and runs lint on Node 24.

```bash
npm ci
npm run lint
npm test
npm run package
```

`npm test` cleans and compiles TypeScript, verifies the bundle, and runs
`node:test`, including temporary-workspace and build-script tests.
`npm run lint` checks `src/**/*.ts` with the recommended ESLint and
typescript-eslint rules and rejects warnings. `npm run test:coverage` adds
coverage reporting.
For extension-host debugging, run `npm run compile` (or `npm run watch`)
before launching **Run Extension** with F5; the launch configuration does
not build automatically.

Rule text is edited in `bundled/ai-rules/`, the tracked source of truth that
ships in the VSIX. Only `.mdc` source files are accepted; `.mdc.disabled`
files and other non-rule files are rejected. Run `npm run sync-bundled`
after adding, removing, or editing a rule file to regenerate `bundled/manifest.json` and the standalone
`bundled/standalone/AGENTS.md` and its README — commit changed generated
files alongside the rule change. The subagent mode text lives in
`bundled/subagent-mode/section.md` and the fast parallel agent mode text in
`bundled/parallel-mode/section.md`; both are rendered the same way as a rule. Edit the standalone README template in
`scripts/build-standalone.mjs`, not the generated file.

Source rules hold the `{{TEST_COMMAND}}` token verbatim; the extension
substitutes the project's real command on the way into `AGENTS.md`. This
repo's own `AGENTS.md` carries the rendered block as a dogfooded install;
change a rule in `bundled/ai-rules/`, then re-run the install command to
regenerate it. It also has token-efficient subagent mode enabled; after
editing `bundled/subagent-mode/section.md`, re-run the enable command.
Fast parallel agent mode is not enabled here, so its block is not dogfooded.

Requirements are tracked in [docs/REQUIREMENTS.md](./docs/REQUIREMENTS.md).
Cutting a release is documented in [docs/RELEASING.md](./docs/RELEASING.md).
The repository's installed rule pack is in [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md); it
contains only what the extension generates: the rule pack from a fresh
install and the token-efficient subagent mode block.

## Limitations

- Rules are instructions, not enforcement. An AI agent can still misread or
  ignore a rule, and models tend to drop rules under context pressure in long
  sessions — re-state the rule that matters when that happens.
- Rules only load in tools that read `AGENTS.md` (or, for Claude Code,
  `CLAUDE.md`). A tool that reads neither never sees them.
- File mutations are queued per workspace within one extension host. They
  are not coordinated across editor windows or with external writers; save
  pending edits before using rule commands.
- Subagent mode is guidance only. It cannot pin a subagent's model, verify
  that a model is available to your account, or stop an agent from doing the
  work itself on the session model.
- Fast parallel agent mode is guidance only. It cannot force an agent to run
  work in parallel, pick the models it uses, or guarantee that your tool
  supports git worktrees. It spends more tokens than working alone.
- Token-efficient subagent mode and fast parallel agent mode are mutually
  exclusive; enabling one fails while the other is on. Use **Select agent
  mode…** to switch.
- Removing a block does not turn off auto-install. To keep it removed on
  later activation, also disable `aiRules.autoInstallOnOpenWorkspace`.
- The extension manages the rule text itself; it does not verify that code
  changes actually followed it.
